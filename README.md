# OIer Whiteboard

A general practice of GDI+ and Win32 programming.

The whiteboard features a graph editor and that's why it is for OIers.

## Usage

Press `F1` ~ `F4` key to switch between the four modes: Pen, Erase, Text and Graph editor. Then go discover all the other functions yourself.

There will be few docs for this program for I mainly use it myself.

## Build

Use that `Makefile`.
